# Maths

A SuperCollider emulation of the popular Eurorack module.

There are two versions. MathsOG is the original gangster, coded in SC. Maths, MathsC, and MathsT are written in Faust.

MathsOG requires the LFPulseReset UGen. Maths, MathsC, and MathsT are compiled from the Faust binaries.

A compiled Mac version of all plugins is included. The source code is also included and can be compiled for other environments like PD and Max.
